# AI to Extract Content from PDFs

PDF Extract AI is a REST API Endpoint that allows you to extract content from PDFs. It uses machine
learning to identify the structure of a PDF and extract the text, tables, and other content from it.

## How does it work?

PDF Extract AI is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting,
and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to
identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually
extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple
OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form
changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, WorqHat AI uses ML to read and process
any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no
manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted,
whether youâ€™re automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts.
PDF Extract AI can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days.

## Use Cases

- Accurately extract critical business data such as mortgage rates, applicant names, and invoice
totals across a variety of financial forms to process loan and mortgage applications in minutes.

- Better serve your patients and insurers by extracting important patient data from health intake forms, insurance claims, and pre-authorization forms. Keep data organized and in its original context, and eliminate manual review of output.

- Extract data from a variety of forms and documents to automate the processing of invoices, receipts, and other documents.

## How to use it?
