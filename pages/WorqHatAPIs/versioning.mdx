# Versioning

Versioning is a critical part of any API in order to avoid breaking changes with your custom integration with Jasper. Here are a few expectations related to versioning so you can create your integration without fear that it will suddenly and unexpectedly break in the future.

In the event we need to sunset an endpoint, we will notify you with sufficient lead time to migrate to a new, updated endpoint
The following items are not considered breaking changes and therefore will not require advance notice:
* New API endpoints
* New read-only or optional fields
* Endpoints or fields marked as deprecated
